# Aviation Accident Analysis Dashboard & EDA

##  Overview
This project explores a dataset of aviation accidents to uncover insights related to causes, trends, fatalities, and other contributing factors. It aims to support decision-making in aviation safety through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visual storytelling using Tableau dashboards and Python notebooks.

##  Business Understanding

### Stakeholders:
- Aviation Safety Analysts
- Civil Aviation Authorities
- Airline Operators
- Policy Makers and Researchers

### Key Business Questions:
1. What are the major causes of aviation accidents?
2. Which years recorded the highest number of accidents or fatalities?
3. How do factors such as weather, purpose of flight, and aircraft type affect the accident outcome?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

### Source of Data
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle Aviation Accident Database](https://www.kaggle.com/), which contains detailed records of aviation incidents over several years.

### Data description
- Columns include: Date, Location, Aircraft Type, Purpose of Flight, Weather Conditions, Total Fatalities, Number Aboard, and more.
- Size: 83,000 records.
- Period covered: Mid-1900s to recent years.
- The data was cleaned for missing values and anomalies prior to analysis.

## Visualizations

### 1. Accident Trends Over the Years
Shows how accident frequency and fatality counts change year by year, helping identify peaks and periods of safety improvement.

### 2. Weather Conditions vs Fatalities
Compares fatalities across different weather conditions, revealing how poor weather correlates with worse accident outcomes.

### 3. Purpose of Flight Distribution
Highlights which types of flights (e.g., commercial, personal, military) are most associated with accidents and fatalities.

### 4. Accidents by Phase of Flight
Higlights which part of flight is mostly dangerous 9e.g takeoff landindg cruising and others)

  ### Key Findings:
- Finding 1: The number of accidents has generally decreased over the years, showing improved aviation safety.
- Finding 2: Bad weather conditions (e.g., storms, fog) are associated with significantly higher fatality rates.
- Finding 3: Personal and training flights report more accidents than commercial flights, possibly due to less regulated environments or pilot inexperience.

This project supports better safety recommendations by identifying the factors that most commonly contribute to serious aviation incidents.
